# Toy store
This repos contains a sample source code for an E-Commerce toy store webpage.
In this projects these apps are added up-to now:

## 1. members
This app is responsible for management of members and their related actions and information such as log-in/out, registration, purchases etc.

## 2. api
This app is created for future api development and for now it just returns information from the database about the products.

## 3. products
This app as the name shouts is for the products and their properties.

## 4. base
In most of my projects I prefer to have a base app in order to control the main flow and general operations of the whole project. I don't say it is a good practice and I'm trying to improve my knowledge about best practices and alter it but I've done it this way in this project.
